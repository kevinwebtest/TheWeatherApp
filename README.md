# The Weather App
The Weather App tells the user current and forecast upcoming weather. Here are some of the things it can do:
- It provides the current weather and upcoming weather for the next few hours and days.
- It shows the current temperature based on the user's location.
- It shows the time of when the sunrise and sunset happen based on the user's location.

It is made using React Native. Here's a link to play with the app, for iOS and Android: https://expo.dev/@kevin_setiawan/TheWeatherApp (You need to download Expo to use the app)
